Hello! I'm Zhang Hanqi (张涵萁), an undergraduate student majoring in **Electrical Engineering** at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (QS Ranking: #54), expected to graduate in June 2026. I am also a student member of the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE).  
As a **first-class honour** student with demonstrated research capabilities, I am driven by a profound intellectual curiosity to advance knowledge in electromechanical systems. Currently, I am conducting research under the supervision of Professor Shuangxia Niu from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.  
My research interests lie in **Electric Vehicle Technologies, Motor control, Power Electronics, Motor Body Design**, particularly **Rotary-linear Machines**, with **Applications in Electric Vehicles and Robotics**.
