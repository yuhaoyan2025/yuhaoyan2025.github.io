Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computational Chemistry at the University of Manchester, where I am advised by Prof. **Nikolas Kaltsoyannis**. Before joining the University of Manchester, I obtained my M.S. degree in Chemical Technology from Tianjin University (Prof. **Qingfeng Ge**) in 2022. I also hold a B.E. degree in Chemical Engineering and Technology from China University of Petroleum (2019), and completed exchange programs at Khalifa University (Prof. **Lourdes F. Vega**) and Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (Malaysia).  

My background is rooted in theoretical and computational chemistry. Moving forward, my research interests are focused on nanoscale computation, specifically its applications in materials and drug design. I possess strong expertise in various computational methodologies including **Density Functional Theory (DFT), molecular simulations (VASP, LAMMPS)**, and **quantum chemistry calculations (Gaussian)**. I am also highly proficient in **Python** for data analysis and simulation workflow automation, enabling me to explore complex systems for innovative solutions.  

Please find my **CV** and **Google Scholar** [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6IZOUtEAAAAJ). I am expected to be on the job market in late 2025 / early 2026. Please feel free to reach out :)
